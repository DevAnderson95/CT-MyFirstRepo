My journey is only juat beginning. I am very excited to get started and continue to learn the 
concepts and originality of coding. Although I tend to overlook and overthink many problems that I 
have come across during my attendance at Coding Temple, I feel much more confident with the learning 
material of the new cohort that I have the privelage to attend. I soon hope to be able to take the tools 
and knowledge i have gained from Coding Temple.
